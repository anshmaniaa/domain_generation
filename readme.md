I want to create a complete analysis of the similarity based solution here the analysis will include:

1. all the llms that we have used for this purpose:
    - mistral 8*7b (groq)
    - mistral 7b (bedrock)
    - mistral 8*7b (bedrock)
    - RNS

2. cost and latency analysis
    - each request
    - multithreaded responses
    - synchronous responses
    
3. similarity based search results
    - embeddings model  
        - hugginface open source model
    - generation model
        - mistral 8*7b (groq)
        - mistral 7b (bedrock)
        - mistral 8*7b (bedrock)
        - RNS
    
    ** embed all the responses in the embeddings model and do comparitive analysis of similarity searches with the query and the converted output **


4. sample space
